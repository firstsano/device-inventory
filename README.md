## Notes

* Ember-changeset plugin has not complete support for relations at the moment, therefore
  one had to use proxy models for relations in routes, and setup changesets before save.
* Ember-model-table selectedItems can be bound through js object (array for example). So
  if one uses that object with proper observable methods (pushObject, removeObject), full
  control of private 'selectedItems' property can be achieved.
